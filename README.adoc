This guide walks through the process of using the https://geode.apache.org/[{apache-geode-name}]'s data management system to cache
certain calls from your application code.

TIP: For more general knowledge of {apache-geode-name} concepts and accessing data from {apache-geode-name},
read through the guide, https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-gemfire/[Accessing Data with {apache-geode-name}].

== What you'll build

You'll build a service that requests quotes from a CloudFoundry hosted Quote service
and caches them in {apache-geode-name}.

Then, you'll see that fetching the same quote again eliminates the expensive call to the Quote service since
Spring's Cache Abstraction, backed by {apache-geode-name}, will be used to cache the results, given the same request.

The Quote service is located at...

....
https://quoters.apps.pcfone.io
....

The Quote service has the following API...

....
GET /api         - get all quotes
GET /api/random  - get random quote
GET /api/{id}    - get specific quote
....

== Starting with Spring Initializr

For all Spring applications, you should start with the https://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr]. Spring Initializr
offers a fast way to pull in all the dependencies you need for an application and does a lot of the set up for you.
This example needs "_Spring for Apache Geode_" dependency.

[[initial]]
== Create a bindable object for fetching data

Now that you've set up the project and build system, you can focus on defining the domain objects necessary to capture
the bits you need to pull quotes (the data) from the Quote service.

`src/main/java/hello/Quote.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Quote.java[]
----

The `Quote` domain class has `id` and `quote` properties. These are the two primary attributes you will gather
further along in this guide. The implementation of the `Quote` class has been simplified by the use of
https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok].

In addition to `Quote`, the `QuoteResponse` captures the entire payload of the response sent by the Quote service
sent in the quote request. It includes the `status` (a.k.a. `type`) of the request along with the `quote`.  This class
also uses https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] to simplify the implementation.

`src/main/java/hello/QuoteResponse.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/QuoteResponse.java[]
----

A typical response from the Quote service appears as follows:

[source,java,tabsize=2script]
----
{
  "type":"success",
  "value": {
    "id":1,
    "quote":"Working with Spring Boot is like pair-programming with the Spring developers."
  }
}
----

Both classes are marked with `@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown=true)`. This means even though other JSON attributes
may be retrieved, they'll be ignored.

[[service]]
== Query Quote service for data

Your next step is to create a service class that queries for quotes.

`src/main/java/hello/QuoteService.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/QuoteService.java[]
----

The `QuoteService` uses _Spring's_ `RestTemplate` to query the Quote service's https://quoters.apps.pcfone.io/api[API].
The Quote service returns a JSON object, but _Spring_ uses Jackson to bind the data to a `QuoteResponse` and ultimately,
a `Quote` object.

The key piece of this service class is how `requestQuote` has been annotated with `@Cacheable("Quotes")`.
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#cache[_Spring's Caching Abstraction_]
intercepts the call to `requestQuote` to check whether the service method has already been called. If so, _Spring's
Caching Abstraction_ just returns the cached copy. Otherwise, _Spring_ proceeds to invoke the method, store the response
in the cache, and then return the results to the caller.

We also used the `@CachePut` annotation on the `requestRandomQuote` service method.  Since the quote returned from
this service method invocation will be random, we don't know which quote we will receive.  Therefore, we cannot consult
the cache (i.e. `Quotes`) prior to the call, but we can cache the result of the call, which will have a positive
affect on subsequent `requestQuote(id)` calls, assuming the quote of interest was randomly selected
and cached previously.

The `@CachePut` uses a SpEL expression ("`#result.id`") to access the result of the service method invocation
and retrieve the ID of the `Quote` to use as the cache key. You can learn more about _Spring's Cache Abstraction_
SpEL context http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#cache-spel-context[here].

NOTE: You must supply the name of the cache. We named it "Quotes" for demonstration purposes, but in production,
it is recommended to pick an appropriately descriptive name. This also means different methods can be associated
with different caches. This is useful if you have different configuration settings for each cache, such as
different expiration or eviction policies, etc.

Later on when you run the code, you will see the time it takes to run each call and be able to discern the impact that
caching has on service response times. This demonstrates the value of caching certain calls. If your application is
constantly looking up the same data, caching the results can improve your performance dramatically.

[[executable]]
== Make the application executable

Although {apache-geode-name} caching can be embedded in web apps and WAR files, the simpler approach demonstrated below
creates a standalone application. You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java
`main()` method.

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/main/spring-boot-application.adoc[]

At the top of the configuration is a single, vital annotation: `@EnableGemfireCaching`. This turns on caching (i.e. is
meta-annotated with _Spring's_ `@EnableCaching` annotation) and declares additional, important beans in the background
to support caching using {apache-geode-name} as the caching provider.

The first bean is an instance of `QuoteService` used to access the Quotes REST-ful Web service.

The other two are needed to cache Quotes and perform the actions of the application.

- `quotesRegion` defines a {apache-geode-name} `LOCAL` client Region inside the cache to store quotes.
It is specifically named "Quotes" to match the usage of `@Cacheable("Quotes")` on our `QuoteService` method.
- `runner` is an instance of the _Spring Boot_ `ApplicationRunner` interface used to run our application.

The first time a quote is requested (using `requestQuote(id)`), a cache miss occurs and the service method
will be invoked, incurring a noticeable delay that is no where close to zero ms.  In this case, caching is linked by
the input parameters (i.e. `id`) of the service method, `requestQuote`. In other words, the `id` method parameter is
the cache key. Subsequent requests for the same quote identified by ID, will result in a cache hit, thereby avoiding
the expensive service call.

For demonstration purposes, the call to the `QuoteService` is wrapped in a separate method (`requestQuote` inside the
`Application` class) to capture the time to make the service call. This lets you see exactly how long any one request
is taking.

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/main/build_an_executable_jar_subhead.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/main/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]

Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.

....
"@springboot with @springframework is pure productivity! Who said in #java one has to write double the code than in other langs? #newFavLib"
Cache Miss [true] - Elapsed Time [776 ms]
"@springboot with @springframework is pure productivity! Who said in #java one has to write double the code than in other langs? #newFavLib"
Cache Miss [false] - Elapsed Time [0 ms]
"Really loving Spring Boot, makes stand alone Spring apps easy."
Cache Miss [true] - Elapsed Time [96 ms]
....

From this you can see that the first call to the Quote service for a quote took 776 ms and resulted in a cache miss.
However, the second call requesting the same quote took 0 ms and resulted in a cache hit. This clearly shows that
the second call was cached and never actually hit the Quote service. However, when a final service call for a specific,
non-cached quote request is made, it took 96 ms and resulted in a cache miss since this new quote was not previously
in the cache before the call.

== Summary

Congratulations! You've just built a service that performed an expensive operation and tagged it so that it will
cache results.
